Objectives:/
Making a trauma game-like experiance for arahnophobia and entophobia,
we try to encorporate a experiente that lets the player run on a bunch
of componenets(rooms) that will spawn insects(/spiders) and make it 
fight or compleat tasks to advance in order to make him concentrate
and try to take away his/her's fear./

Rooms:/
1.Each room should include a mini puzzle for the player to concentrate
2.The room will have a dynamic number of spiders and insects(large) that
will perturbe his attencian but not in any way make him fail./
3.The fail should come from his in-ability to concentrate at the task at
hand./
4.Try to encorporate using the spiders to solve the puzzle./
5.Room designes should be discussed with all./
