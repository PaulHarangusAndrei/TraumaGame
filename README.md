Objectives:<br>
Making a trauma game-like experiance for arahnophobia and entophobia,
we try to encorporate a experiente that lets the player run on a bunch
of componenets(rooms) that will spawn insects(/spiders) and make it 
fight or compleat tasks to advance in order to make him concentrate
and try to take away his/her's fear.<br>

Rooms:<br>
1.Each room should include a mini puzzle for the player to concentrate.<br>
2.The room will have a dynamic number of spiders and insects(large) that
will perturbe his attencian but not in any way make him fail.<br>
3.The fail should come from his in-ability to concentrate at the task at
hand.<br>
4.Try to encorporate using the spiders to solve the puzzle.<br>
5.Room designes should be discussed with all.<br>
